// Crispy Grid Configuration
//==========================
// Copy this into your app in order to customize the grid

// Configure grid for every device you whish to respond to
// The nth entry of any list belongs to the nth device (the order of $devices matters).
// The lists can take any number of devices, including 1.
// If you do not plan to support multiple devices, you may want to delete all but the first entries.
// The first device is the default for all grid helpers.
// Consider to set mobile as default device when following the mobile-first design approach.
